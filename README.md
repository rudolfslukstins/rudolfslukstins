# Hi there <img src="https://media.tenor.com/62H2GipHhHUAAAAi/marvel-future-revolution-marvel-future-fight.gif" width="30px">, I am RÅ«dolfs LukstiÅ†Å¡! 
---

Love to learn and explore full-stack development. Hard-working, dedicated, fast to learn, and prepared for challenges in my way. 
Able to effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate in a team setting.
Would like to learn new skills and grow as a programmer.
Every day of the week, dedication and discipline trumps excellence and giftedness. Every moment I choose to do what I know is right rather than what I feel will be easier, I am winning over myself.
